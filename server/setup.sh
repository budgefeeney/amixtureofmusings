# This is the server configuration script for the amixtureofmusings website.
# Given a totally new server, it eliminates password access, sets up a firewall,
# sets up an nginx webserver, configures mail forwarding, and sets up
# auto-updates.
#
# The setup presumes the server is fairly starved of resources, and so is pretty
# light, e.g. a single CPU worker for Nginx, no access-log and no SSL.
#
# The following pre-requisites need to exist
#
# 1. You're logged in as root
# 2. You have already set up an authorized_keys file to log in as root without
#    a password (see https://www.linode.com/docs/security/securing-your-server)
#
# This script needs to be run as root, and is interactive, so you need to keep
# an eye on it. Once it's done you'll need to double-check that you can log
# in as the non-root user with full sudo privileges, and then if so commit to
# the hardened SSH access by restarting the SSH daemon. A typical run looks like
#
# local> scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@host:~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# local> scp server/setup.sh root@server:/root/setup.sh
# local> ssh root@server
#
# server> USER=...
# server> adduser $USER
# server> chmod +x setup.sh
# server> ./setup.sh
# server> systemctl restart sshd
